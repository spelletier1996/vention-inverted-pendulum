### Pendulum SIM
Need to research a simple pendulum model to implement 
Seems to be a decent paper on the subject https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4444887
Seems that simply balancing the the pol is much simpler than the full swing up problem maybe thats the way to go https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/acrobot.html
Small angle approximation
https://github.com/jasleon/Inverted-Pendulum/blob/main/src/inverted_pendulum.cpp - good reference for checking approach
